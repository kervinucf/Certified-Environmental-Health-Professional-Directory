## How It Works

The application sources its data from two primary records:

2. Public Florida state government employee records

### Cross-Referencing Data

The application cross-references the data from these two sources to provide users with a comprehensive view of the certified professionals and their current positions within the state government. By merging the data from both sources, the application ensures that users have accurate and up-to-date information about the professionals and their employment status.

To achieve this, the application performs the following steps:

1. Retrieve data from both active certified environmental health professionals and public Florida state government employee records
2. Match professionals based on their unique identifiers (e.g., certification number, name)
3. Combine the matched data to create a unified record for each professional
4. Display the cross-referenced data in a user-friendly table format
